# AI Startup Pitch Evaluator

An **AI-powered system that analyzes startup pitch decks and evaluates their investment readiness**.

The system extracts key business insights from uploaded pitch decks and uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate:

- Market opportunity analysis
- Business model evaluation
- Competitive advantage assessment
- Funding risk assessment
- Investor readiness scoring
- Strategic recommendations for founders

---

# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build an **AI-driven tool that evaluates startup pitch decks like a venture capital analyst**.

The system automatically analyzes pitch decks and generates structured investor insights including:

- Market opportunity analysis
- Business model evaluation
- Competitive advantage evaluation
- Funding risk assessment
- Investor readiness score
- AI-powered recommendations

---

# Workflow

## 1️.Pitch Deck Upload

The user uploads a **startup pitch deck (PDF)** through the Streamlit interface.

---

## 2️.Document Ingestion

The system parses the PDF using **PyMuPDF**, extracting slide text and preparing it for analysis.

---

## 3️.Text Chunking

The extracted text is segmented into logical sections to improve semantic retrieval.

---

## 4️.Embedding Generation

Each section is converted into vector embeddings using:


sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2


These embeddings represent the semantic meaning of the content.

---

## 5️.Vector Database Storage

Embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**, which enables semantic similarity search.

---

## 6️.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

When analysis is requested:

1. Relevant pitch sections are retrieved from the vector database
2. Retrieved context is passed to the LLM
3. The LLM generates structured analysis

---

## 7️.AI Evaluation Modules

### Market Opportunity Analyzer

Evaluates:

- TAM / SAM / SOM
- Market growth potential
- Scalability signals

---

### Business Model Analyzer

Identifies:

- Revenue streams
- Pricing model
- Customer acquisition strategy
- Missing business components

---

### Competitive Advantage Evaluator

Analyzes:

- Competitors mentioned
- Differentiation strategy
- Market positioning

---

### Funding Risk Assessment Engine

Detects:

- Execution risks
- Market risks
- Financial risks

And generates a **risk score**.

---

## 8️.Investor Readiness Scoring

Outputs from all modules are combined using a **weighted scoring system** to produce:


Investor Readiness Score (0–100)


---

## 9️.AI Recommendation Generator

The system provides improvement suggestions such as:

- Missing slide information
- Investor presentation improvements
- Market validation suggestions
